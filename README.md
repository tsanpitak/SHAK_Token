The SHAK Token is the Stable Hyper Algorithmic Kryptocurrency. It is intended to be used as a stable alternative to store value as compared to fiat currencies, commodities, or even other stablecoins. Our cryptocurrency is backed by a basket of different currencies and other assets. With our algorithms continuously balancing the basket, we aim to provide a store of value that stays above the volatile fluctuations that impact commonly held assets.
