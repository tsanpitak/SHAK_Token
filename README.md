The SHAK Token is the Stable Hyper Algorithmic Kryptocurrency. It is intended to be used as a stable alternative to store value as compared to fiat currencies, commodities, or even other stablecoins. Our cryptocurrency is backed by a basket of different currencies and other assets. With our algorithms continuously balancing the basket, we aim to provide a store of value that stays above the volatile fluctuations that impact commonly held assets.

## Balancing Methodology
---

Stability is the cornerstone of our cryptocurrency. As such, we are evaluating the currency basket we hold daily. In addition to monitoring the interday fluctuations in exchange rates, we also take a long-term approach by looking at key indicators for the countries of our currencies to anticipate future currency movements. This country indicator balancing is done at a lesser frequency as these indicators are only released annually.
